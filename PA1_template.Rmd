## Loading and preprocessing the data



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values
```{r}
is.weekday <- function(x){
    w <- as.Date(x)
    w <- weekdays(w)
    if (w == "Saturday" || w == "Sunday")
        FALSE
    else
        TRUE
}
```


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
